              distinct samples, which can be subsequently pooled. By sequencing
              these tags alongside the cellular transcriptome, we can assign

              multiplets, and ``super-load'' commercial droplet-based systems
              for significant cost reduction. We validate our approach using a
              complementary genetic approach and demonstrate how hashing can

  abstract  = "Matrix decompositions are fundamental tools in the area of
               applied mathematics, statistical computing, and machine
               learning. In particular, low-rank matrix decompositions are
               vital, and widely used for data analysis, dimensionality
               reduction, and data compression. Massive datasets, however, pose
               a computational challenge for traditional algorithms, placing
               significant constraints on both memory and processing power.
               Recently, the powerful concept of randomness has been introduced
               as a strategy to ease the computational load. The essential idea
               of probabilistic algorithms is to employ some amount of
               randomness in order to derive a smaller matrix from a
               high-dimensional data matrix. The smaller matrix is then used to
               compute the desired low-rank approximation. Such algorithms are
               shown to be computationally efficient for approximating matrices
               with low-rank structure. We present the R package rsvd, and
               provide a tutorial introduction to randomized matrix
               decompositions. Specifically, randomized routines for the
               singular value decomposition, (robust) principal component
               analysis, interpolative decomposition, and CUR decomposition are
               discussed. Several examples demonstrate the routines, and show

              single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies and

              accompanied by cell cycle changes, interplay that is of central
              importance for immunity but is still incompletely understood.
              Here, we interrogate and quantitatively model how proliferation
              is linked to differentiation in CD4+ T cells. RESULTS: We perform
              ex vivo single-cell RNA-sequencing of CD4+ T cells during a mouse
              model of infection that elicits a type 2 immune response and
              infer that the differentiated, cytokine-producing cells cycle
              faster than early activated precursor cells. To dissect this
              phenomenon quantitatively, we determine expression profiles
              across consecutive generations of differentiated and
              undifferentiated cells during Th2 polarization in vitro. We
              predict three discrete cell states, which we verify by
              single-cell quantitative PCR. Based on these three states, we
              extract rates of death, division and differentiation with a
              branching state Markov model to describe the cell population
              dynamics. From this multi-scale modelling, we infer a significant
              acceleration in proliferation from the intermediate activated
              cell state to the mature cytokine-secreting effector state. We
              confirm this acceleration both by live imaging of single Th2
              cells and in an ex vivo Th1 malaria model by single-cell
              RNA-sequencing. CONCLUSION: The link between cytokine secretion
              and proliferation rate holds both in Th1 and Th2 cells in vivo
              and in vitro, indicating that this is likely a general phenomenon
              in adaptive immunity.",
